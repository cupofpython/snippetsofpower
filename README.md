# Welcome to my code library.

I'm happy you have stumbled upon my little snippets of code. In my spare time, I solve [UCF Programming Team](https://lpc.ucfprogrammingteam.org/index.php/past-contests/past-problem-sets) 
practice and local programming contest problems. These problems are not necessarily trivial. The UCF Programming Team is highly-competitive and [ranked best in the United States and #13 in the world.](http://today.ucf.edu/ucf-wins-national-computer-programming-championship-places-13th-world/)

I hope that solving some of these problems can accomplish several goals, including, but not limited to: 
- Developing a portfolio of functional programs
- Sharpening my critical thinking skills
- Showcasing my programming stylistic choices and thought processes 
- Speeding up my dev and debugging time
- Practicing for interviews
- Strengthening my skills in Java/C, learn new languages by doing 

Thanks for swinging by. :sparkling_heart:
